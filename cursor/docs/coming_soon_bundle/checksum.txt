# Bundle Hash: [TO_BE_CALCULATED_AFTER_FINALIZATION]

# Verification Instructions:
# 1. Calculate SHA256 hash of each file
# 2. Compare with checksums above
# 3. Verify bundle integrity matches
# 4. Check file sizes match expected values

# Note: Checksums will be updated after final bundle compilation
# Use: sha256sum filename to generate checksums
